Upload the notebook baseline-2-beatnet.ipynb to Google Colab.

Upload the data.zip to Colab.

Set the working_dir variable in the notebook to the path to the data folder. (By default it is set to /content, so if you upload on local runtime no change is needed)

Run all the cells (except training)

Load the models and run your inference.

README

This is to run the "BeatNet" proposed by "Heydari et. al." in "ISMIR 2021" (Baseline 2)

Step 1 - Open the "baseline-2-beatnet.ipynb" using Google Colab.
Step 2 - Upload the "data.zip" file to Google Colab Session to local runtime ('/content/').
Step 3 - Run the notebook.
Step 4 - In case you simply want to test on our models, just run the Colab file as it is.
Step 5 - In case you want to re-train the network, you would need to uncomment the cells which
	are fully commented (the commented first line of the cells instruct that these cells are
	for training).
