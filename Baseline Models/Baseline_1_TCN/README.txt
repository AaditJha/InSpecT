README

This is to run the "TCN Network" proposed by "Bock et. al." in "ISMIR 2020/2019" (Baseline 1)

Step 1 - Download our submission from Google Classroom
Step 2 - Unzip the "Datasets.zip" file and upload the "Datasets/" directory to Google Drive with
	the following directory structure:
	/Datasets/DL/Project/

	So, when you would mount your drive using the Google Colab Notebook, the mounted project 
	directory needs to be visible as:
	/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/DL/Project/

	So, for example, the directory structure to "baseline_1_train_attempt_1/" would be:
	/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/DL/Project/baseline_1_train_attempt_1/

Step 3 - Run the "Baseline_1_Bock.ipynb" using Google Colab.
Step 4 - In case you simply want to test on our models, just run the Colab file as it is.
Step 5 - In case you want to re-train the network, you would need to uncomment the cells which
	are fully commented (the commented first line of the cells instruct that these cells are
	for training).
